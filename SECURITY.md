## Supported Versions
Only the latest release receives security fixes.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| Latest release | :white_check_mark: |
| Any older release | :x: |

Upgrade to the [latest release](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/ebook2audiobook/releases/latest) before reporting.
Your version is in `VERSION.txt`.

<a id="reporting-a-vulnerability"></a>
## Reporting a Vulnerability
Report it in a [new issue](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/ebook2audiobook/issues/new/choose) with the `Security report` template.
Search the open and closed issues first to be sure it hasn't been reported already.

Include:
- E2A version (`VERSION.txt`), OS, script mode (Native/Docker) and process mode (Gradio/Headless)
- The affected component (file, CLI option, GUI element, workflow)
- Steps to reproduce
- The impact: what an attacker can do, and what access they need first (local network, GUI access, a crafted file, etc.)
- A suggested fix, if you have one

> [!IMPORTANT]
**Issues are public: describe the vulnerability and how to reproduce it, but don't post a ready-to-use exploit.<br>
If a full proof of concept is needed, a maintainer will ask you for it.**

Use public-domain texts and your own test files only. Never attach copyrighted eBooks, real personal data or secrets.

> [!WARNING]
**Reports copied from an automated scanner or an A.I. tool without a verified, reproducible impact will be closed.**

<a id="what-to-expect"></a>
## What to Expect
E2A is maintained by volunteers. We aim to:
- acknowledge your report within 7 days
- confirm or decline it in the issue, and keep you informed of the progress
- release a fix, crediting you in the release notes

There is no bug bounty.

<a id="scope"></a>
## Scope
**In scope**
- Path traversal, arbitrary file read or write through uploaded or processed files (eBooks, eBook directories,
  voices, custom model ZIPs, voice maps)
- Code execution through crafted input (eBooks, archives, text, SML tags), beyond the model risk described in
  [Models and voices](#models-and-voices)
- Web GUI session isolation: a user reaching another session's files, audiobooks or settings
- Leak of secrets (Audiobookshelf API token, Hugging Face tokens) in logs, crash reports or the GUI
- Crash report redaction failures: personal data leaving the machine (see [Crash reports](#crash-reports))
- Integrity of downloads: engines, packages, models, voices or sources fetched from a location an attacker can control
- Launch and uninstall scripts, `Dockerfile`, compose files, notebooks and GitHub workflows of this repository

**Out of scope**
- Vulnerabilities in third-party projects (Gradio, PyTorch, coqui-tts, calibre, ffmpeg, the TTS engines, etc.):
  report them upstream. Do tell us if E2A uses them in a vulnerable way or pins an affected version.
- The documented behaviors listed in [Security Considerations for Users](#security-considerations-for-users)
- Denial of service of your own instance through very large or complex eBooks
- Misuse of the tool (DRM, copyright, cloning someone's voice without consent): not a vulnerability,
  see the notice in the [README](README.md)
- Issues of the Hugging Face, Google Colab or Kaggle platforms hosting the demos: report them to the platform

## Security Considerations for Users

<a id="web-gui-exposure"></a>
### Web GUI exposure
- The GUI listens on `0.0.0.0:7860` by default (`interface_host` and `interface_port` in `lib/conf.py`):
  **any device on your network can reach it, and there is no authentication.**
- Anyone who can reach the GUI can upload files and custom models and run conversions on your hardware.
  Treat GUI access as access to the account running E2A.
- To restrict it to your machine:
  - Native: set `interface_host = '127.0.0.1'` in `lib/conf.py`
  - Docker: `-p 127.0.0.1:7860:7860` instead of `-p 7860:7860`
  - Compose: `"127.0.0.1:7860:7860"` in the `ports` of `docker-compose.yml` / `podman-compose.yml`
- For remote access, use a VPN or an SSH tunnel, or a reverse proxy with authentication and HTTPS.
- `--share` creates a public `gradio.live` link through Gradio's relay servers: **anyone with the link has full GUI access.**
  Use it only temporarily, and never on a machine holding private data.

<a id="models-and-voices"></a>
### Models and voices
- Model checkpoints (`.pth`, `.bin`, `.ckpt`, `.pt`) can contain pickled Python code that runs when the model is loaded.
  Only use custom and fine-tuned models from sources you trust, and prefer `.safetensors` models when available.
- On first use, E2A downloads engines, models and voices from Hugging Face, GitHub and PyPI. Engines with their own
  venv install the upstream sources pinned in `lib/conf_models.py`.

<a id="crash-reports"></a>
### Crash reports
- E2A sends anonymized crash reports by default. On an unhandled exception, a JSON report (exception, traceback,
  E2A and package versions, OS and device information, non-identifying settings such as engine, language and device)
  is posted over HTTPS to `bug_report_url` in `lib/conf.py`.
- File paths, your user name, e-mail addresses, IP addresses, tokens and the Audiobookshelf URL and token are redacted
  before sending. Exception messages are truncated, but may still contain a fragment of the text being converted.
- To disable it, set the environment variable `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, or set `bug_report_enabled = False` in `lib/conf.py`.

<a id="secrets"></a>
### Secrets
- The Audiobookshelf token (`--abs_api_token` or the GUI) is only sent to your Audiobookshelf server (`--abs_url`).
  Prefer an HTTPS URL, and a dedicated Audiobookshelf user limited to the library E2A uploads to.
- Review terminal logs before attaching them to a public issue: remove tokens, paths and anything private.

<a id="installation"></a>
### Installation
- The launch scripts install `uv`, Homebrew (macOS) or Scoop (Windows) and the system programs E2A needs.
  Read them before running if your environment requires it.
- Run E2A as a regular user, not as root or administrator. Docker gives the strongest isolation from your system.
